# fomo-camera
An internet connected camera for live participatory photography

Fomo camera is an experiment to see what happens when you give a camera to an attendee at an event and then ask them to pass it on to the next person they bump into. The cameras will take images every minute and upload the result to the web.
The hardware will be contained in a large decorated enclosure.

In development for Light Night 17 at Maker Nights @ DoES
